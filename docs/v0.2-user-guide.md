# Bloxt v0.2 - Nested Blocks User Guide

## ✨ What's New in v0.2

### Individual Block Dragging
In v0.2, **every block is individually draggable** - including nested content under headers. This gives you maximum flexibility to reorganize your document structure.

### Visual Hierarchy
- Nested blocks are displayed with **indentation** and **visual indicators**
- Left borders show the nesting relationship
- Slightly transparent styling indicates nested content

### How It Works

#### Before (v0.1): 
Only top-level blocks were draggable

#### Now (v0.2):
```markdown
## Section A              ← Draggable
This paragraph          ← Draggable individually
### Subsection A.1      ← Draggable individually  
Content here            ← Draggable individually

## Section B             ← Draggable
Different content       ← Draggable individually
```

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

Access via **Settings → Bloxt** to configure:

- **Enable Nested Blocks**: Master toggle for hierarchical display
- **Exclude H1 Headers**: Prevent H1 from being dragged (default: ✅)
- **Exclude H2-H6 Headers**: Individual toggles for each level
- **Exclude Paragraphs**: Prevent paragraphs from being dragged
- **Exclude Frontmatter**: Keep frontmatter fixed (default: ✅)

## 📝 Best Practices

### Recommended Settings:
- ✅ **H1 Excluded**: Keeps main document title stable
- ✅ **Frontmatter Excluded**: Preserves metadata
- ✅ **Nested Blocks Enabled**: Shows document structure clearly

### Document Organization:
1. Use H1 for main document title (non-draggable)
2. Use H2 for major sections (draggable)
3. Use H3+ for subsections (individually draggable)
4. Paragraphs can be moved independently

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Drag Behavior:
- Each block moves independently
- Document structure is automatically reconstructed
- Changes sync immediately to markdown
- Visual hierarchy preserved during editing

### Performance:
- Optimized for documents with complex nesting
- Smooth drag animations
- Debounced parsing for responsive editing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Can't drag a specific block
**Solution**: Check Settings → Bloxt to ensure that block type isn't excluded

**Issue**: Nested display looks confusing
**Solution**: Toggle "Enable Nested Blocks" off for flat view

**Issue**: Changes not saving
**Solution**: Ensure you have an active markdown file open in Obsidian
