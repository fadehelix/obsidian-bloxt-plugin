# Bloxt v0.1 Implementation Overview

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- **Block Detection**: Automatically parses markdown content to identify headers (H1-H6) and paragraphs
- **Frontmatter Support**: YAML frontmatter is preserved but excluded from draggable blocks
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Using @dnd-kit library for smooth, accessible drag and drop
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes in the block editor immediately update the original markdown file
- **Visual Feedback**: Blocks show rotation and opacity changes during drag operations
- **Automatic Refresh**: Smart polling detects content changes and updates blocks automatically
- **Manual Refresh**: Refresh button for immediate updates when needed

### Performance Optimizations
- **Content Parsing Debounce**: 300ms delay to avoid excessive parsing during rapid content changes
- **Drag Activation Constraint**: Requires 8px movement before drag starts (prevents accidental drags)
- **Smart Content Monitoring**: 1.5-second interval polling only when view is visible
- **Optimized Event Handling**: File switch detection without aggressive editor event listeners

### Architecture

#### Main Components
1. **`main.ts`** - Plugin entry point, registers views and commands
2. **`BloxtView.tsx`** - Custom Obsidian view that hosts the React block editor
3. **`BlockEditor.tsx`** - Main React component handling drag & drop logic
4. **`DraggableBlock.tsx`** - Individual draggable block component
5. **`markdown-parser.ts`** - Utilities for parsing and reconstructing markdown

#### File Structure
```
src/
├── types.ts                    # TypeScript interfaces
├── BloxtView.tsx              # Obsidian view integration
├── components/
│   ├── BlockEditor.tsx        # Main drag & drop component  
│   └── DraggableBlock.tsx     # Individual block component
└── utils/
    └── markdown-parser.ts     # Markdown parsing utilities
```

## How It Works

1. **User opens Bloxt editor** via ribbon icon or command palette
2. **Content parsing** - Current markdown file is parsed into block objects
3. **React rendering** - Blocks are rendered as draggable components
4. **Drag operations** - @dnd-kit handles the drag & drop logic
5. **Content reconstruction** - Reordered blocks are converted back to markdown
6. **File update** - Original file is updated with new content order
7. **Manual refresh** - User can click refresh button to update blocks when new content is added

## Key Technical Decisions

### ✅ React + TypeScript
- Follows official Obsidian guidelines
- Type safety for better development experience
- Component-based architecture for maintainability

### ✅ @dnd-kit Library
- Modern, accessible drag & drop
- Lightweight and modular
- Better than react-beautiful-dnd for our use case

### ✅ Block-based Parsing
- Simple but effective for v0.1
- Focuses on headers and paragraphs only
- Preserves original markdown formatting

## Testing

To test the v0.1 implementation:

1. **Enable the plugin** in Obsidian settings
2. **Open `test-document.md`** (included in project)
3. **Click the blocks icon** in the ribbon
4. **Try dragging** headers and paragraphs around
5. **Verify** that the original file updates correctly

## Known Limitations (v0.1)

- Only supports headers and paragraphs
- No support for lists, quotes, or code blocks yet
- Desktop only (mobile planned for v2.0)
- Basic visual feedback (will be enhanced in v1.0)

## Next Steps (v0.4)

- Add support for block quotes
- Improve visual design
- Add better error handling
- Optimize performance for large documents

## Code Quality

- ✅ Follows KISS principle - minimal, focused implementation
- ✅ DRY - Reusable components and utilities
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ ESLint configuration for code quality
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
