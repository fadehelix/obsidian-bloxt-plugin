# Bloxt Obsidian Plugin

Reimagine document flow: Bloxt introduces block-based editing to Obsidian, letting you physically rearrange ideas through intuitive drag & drop. Organize knowledge spatially, experiment with structures, and break free from linear constraints - all while keeping standard Markdown intact.



## Plan
- v 0.1 - basic block drag&drop.
- v 0.4 - support quotes.
- v 0.5 - support lists.
- v 1.0 - allow to customize UI and support keyboard shortcuts. PLugin is available only for desktop devices.
- v 2.0 - enable plugin for mobile devices.
